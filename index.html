                <h2>Our event(ful) history</h2>

                <p>
                    <P>It all began with a party. While pledging a national fraternity at the University of Iowa, young Donald S. “Buck” Freeman discovered his passion for party decorating and parades. Buck saw an opportunity to use his enthusiasm for bringing
                        people together to create meaningful experiences.
                    </P>
                    <p> A true visionary, Buck firmly believed in creating personal relationships in an impersonal world. As Freeman grew from a humble decorating company to servicing trade shows, conferences, and events across the country, Buck’s commitment
                        to building these meaningful customer relationships became infused throughout the organization.
                    </p>
                    <p> Our never-ending drive to meet customers’ ever-changing needs — and to do it better than anyone else — has grown Freeman to one of the world’s leading event companies.
                    </p>


                </p>

            </p>
            <br> <br> <br> <br>
            <h1>Making moments that matter. From the beginning.</h1>
            <p>Almost a century after Buck threw his first college party, the customers and venues have changed, technology has evolved, our reach is far greater, and the event services we offer far more expansive. Yet even as Freeman continues to grow,
                our commitment to making moments that matter remains the same.

            <p>Hybrid events are more than just streaming an in-person event online. They deliver dynamic, high-quality content, optimized for both in-person and virtual audiences.</p>
            <p>Have you watched a sporting event on television, livestreamed a concert, or tuned in to an awards show? Then you’ve already experienced a taste of what a hybrid event can offer.

                your content online. Hybrid events are a powerful tool to meet your goals and boost your brand</p>
